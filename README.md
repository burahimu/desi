# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my [DESI][desi-course] courses repo!

This repository contains my notes from my Islamic Studies program at IESH in Chaton Chinon. The notes are organized by course and lecture, and cover a variety of topics related to Islamic theology, jurisprudence, history, and spirituality.

> **NOTE:** ⚠️ every note is written in french !

## Table of Contents

## How to Use
Each course folder contains a README file with an overview of the course, as well as subfolders for each lecture. Inside each lecture folder, you'll find a Markdown file with my notes, as well as any relevant images or diagrams.

To view the notes, simply navigate to the relevant folder and click on the Markdown file. You can also download the entire repository and view the notes offline.
